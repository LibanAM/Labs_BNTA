# Java Polymorphism Exercises
We've learned about polymorphism in class, now put that knowledge to use! Please aim to complete points 1 - 4 today (Monday 25th April) and points 5 - 7 tomorrow afternoon (Tuesday 26th April). 

**Please write tests for all your concrete classes so we can be sure that they work. Commit regularly and often.**

This a solo lab, so you can manage your time in a way that works for you. 
Please note that trainers will be available for questions during working hours only. 
You will be asked to submit your code at the end of the day on Tuesday.
We will invite a small, random selection of people to demo their code on Wednesday morning.

## Monday

### 1. Please create a new project, with multiple classes
Use your own concept - don't simply duplicate the examples used in the lessons, or on the textbook. It is really important that you do not skip the planning and diagramming stage!

### 2. Create an abstract class
Your example doesn't have to be real-world, but it should have at least some internal logic to it

### 3. Extend the abstract class with at least 2 sub-classes

### 4. Create a collection which accepts objects of either of those 2 types

## Tuesday

### 5. Implement at least 1 method overload

### 6: Create your own enum to represent a set of constants
Use the enum in a way that makes sense within the logic of your example

### 7 Create an interface and implement it on at least 1 class
Also, use the interface you create as the type of a variable somewhere in your project. New up an object from a class that implements the interface.
